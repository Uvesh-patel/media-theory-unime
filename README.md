## Exam Preparation Tips

### My Exam Experience

First, I was asked to choose a topic to begin with. I chose **"The Three Waves of the Extended Mind Theory"** because it gives a structured summary of the entire course, from the classic view to the more recent ecological and media-integrated perspectives.

Then, I was asked: *"Why do we talk about technical images in this course?"*

I explained that technical images (like photos and videos) are not just tools for communication or memory — they play a **mediational and constitutional role** in shaping our identity and memory. This links directly to the **Mediational-Constitutional Principle (MCP)**, which is part of the third wave of extended mind theory.

### Common Exam Questions

Based on past oral exams, be prepared to answer:

- **What is embodied cognition?**
- **What is enactive cognition?**
- **Can you explain the Parity vs Complementarity Principles?**
- **What is the difference between Constitution and Causality?**
- **What do we mean by Strong vs Weak Embodiment?**
- **What is the Causality-Constitution Fallacy?**
- **Explain Autopoiesis**

### Key Concepts to Master

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Parity Principle** | If external process = internal process in function, it's cognitive |
| **Complementarity** | Internal and external work together, doing different things |
| **Constitution** | Media don't just help cognition — they make it |
| **Autopoiesis** | Self-producing, self-maintaining systems |
| **Affordances** | Action possibilities offered by environment |
| **Technical Images** | Machine-made images that shape memory and identity |
