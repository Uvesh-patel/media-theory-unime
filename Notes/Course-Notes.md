## Topic 1: Classic Cognitivism

### What is Classic Cognitivism?

**Classic Cognitivism** is the traditional theory of how the mind works. According to this view, the mind is like a computer:
- It takes in information (input)
- Processes it using rules or representations (like internal mental images or instructions)
- Produces behavior (output)

This approach sees cognition (thinking, memory, decision-making) as something that happens **inside the brain**, in isolation from the body or the environment.

### Key Terms

- **Mental Representation**: Internal images, symbols, or ideas that stand for something in the world
- **Information Processing**: How the brain receives, stores, and works with information
- **Brain-bound View**: The belief that all thinking happens only in the brain

### Why Is This Important?

Classic Cognitivism has been very influential, especially in early AI and psychology. But modern theories now **criticize** it for ignoring the role of:
- The body (how your posture, movement, and senses affect thinking)
- The environment (how tools and context help us think)
- Social interaction (how we think together with others)

This critique leads us to newer theories, like **Embodied Cognition** and **The Extended Mind**.

## Topic 2: Embodied Cognition & the 4Es

**Embodied Cognition** means that our body is not just something that carries the brain around — it actually plays a key role in how we think.

> Example: You solve math problems differently when using your fingers or drawing shapes. That's because your body helps your brain think.

### The 4Es: A Framework for Modern Cognitive Science

#### 1. Embodied
Cognition depends on the body. Your posture, movements, and physical feelings all shape how you think and feel.

#### 2. Embedded
Cognition happens in context — the environment matters. We use our surroundings (books, phones, tools, maps) to help us think.

#### 3. Extended
The mind can include things outside the head. If you use a notebook or smartphone to remember things, those objects become part of your memory process.

#### 4. Enactive
Cognition comes from active engagement with the world. We learn by doing, moving, sensing. Meaning is made through action.

## Topic 3: The Extended Mind Theory

📘 Based on: Clark & Chalmers (1998) – "The Extended Mind"

The **Extended Mind Hypothesis** says that thinking doesn't only happen in the brain — it can include tools, environments, and objects we interact with regularly.

### Key Example: Otto's Notebook

- **Inga** hears about an art exhibition and remembers that MoMA is on 53rd Street (biological memory)
- **Otto** has Alzheimer's, so he writes things in a notebook he carries (external memory)

**Conclusion**: If something functions like part of your mind, it **is** part of your mind — even if it's outside your body.

### Key Terms

- **Parity Principle**: If a process outside the brain works the same as one inside, it should count as cognition
- **Cognitive System**: Not just the brain, but the whole setup including brain, body, tools, and world
- **Coupling**: A close connection between person and tool
- **Epistemic Action**: An action that helps you think, not just act

### Active vs Passive Externalism

- **Passive Externalism** (Putnam): Meaning depends on the environment, but the world doesn't affect thinking directly
- **Active Externalism** (Clark & Chalmers): The world actively participates in the cognitive process

---

## Topic 4: Enactive Cognition

📘 Based on: Gallagher (2023) – *Embodied and Enactive Approaches to Cognition*

**Enactive Cognition** says we don't receive knowledge passively — we create (enact) it by acting and interacting with the world.

### Key Terms

- **Sense-making**: The process of creating meaning through interaction
- **Sensorimotor Contingency**: The way sensory input changes when you move your body
- **Autopoiesis**: A system that produces and maintains itself (like a living cell)
- **Non-representationalism**: We don't need stored "mental images" — we act and adjust in real time

### Differences Between Enactive and Classic Views

| Classical Cognitivism | Enactive Cognition |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Mind is internal | Mind is relational |
| Knowledge is stored | Knowledge is enacted |
| Focus on representations | Focus on action |
| Passive input from world | Active shaping of world |

## Topic 5: Affordances

📘 Connected to: Enactivism, Ecological Psychology (Gibson), Media Theory

**Affordances** are the possibilities for action that an object or environment offers to a person.

> Example: A chair *affords* sitting, a handle *affords* pulling, a button *affords* pushing — but only if you have a body that can do those actions.

### Key Ideas

- **Affordances are relational**: They depend on both the object AND the user
- **Direct Perception**: We perceive affordances directly — we see what we can do
- **No need for internal models**: We can act immediately based on what we see and feel

### Affordances and Media Theory

- A touchscreen affords swiping, tapping, or zooming
- A smartphone camera affords taking selfies
- A social media feed affords scrolling endlessly

Media scholars use "affordance" to explain how **design shapes behavior**.

## Topic 6: Sense-Making and Dynamic Systems

### What is Sense-Making?

**Sense-making** means the ongoing process by which living beings create meaning through their interaction with the world.

Key Characteristics:
- **Active and Ongoing**: Meaning is not given — it's made through what we do
- **Embodied**: Uses your whole body — not just the brain
- **Situated**: Always depends on where you are and what you're doing

### What Are Dynamic Systems?

A **Dynamic System** is a system that changes over time depending on how its parts interact.

Key Concepts:
- **Self-organization**: The system organizes itself without needing a master plan
- **Non-linearity**: Small changes can have big effects
- **Coupled Systems**: When two systems (like body + world) affect each other in real-time

## Topic 7: Radical Mediation & the Mediational–Constitutional Principle (MCP)

📘 Based on: Prezioso & Parisi (2025) – *Extending the Extended Self*

### What Is Radical Mediation?

**Radical Mediation** is the idea that media don't just transmit information — they actually help to create reality, including your thoughts, emotions, and sense of self.

This view comes from media theorist **Richard Grusin**.

### Mediational–Constitutional Principle (MCP)

Media (especially **technical images**) don't just *help* thinking — they are **part of the thinking process itself**.

Key Definitions:
- **Mediation**: The process by which tools, media, or technologies shape how we think
- **Constitution**: Something is not just influenced, but **made** by something else
- **Technical Images**: Photos, videos, and digital images automatically created by machines (term from **Vilém Flusser**)

> When we scroll through old photos, we don't just recall the past — we **re-create** who we are.

## Topic 8: The Three Waves of the Extended Mind Theory

### 🌊 First Wave: The Parity Principle
Based on: Clark & Chalmers (1998)

If something outside the brain plays the *same role* as something inside it, then it's part of the mind.
- Example: Otto's notebook

### 🌊 Second Wave: The Complementarity Principle
Based on: Sutton, Menary, Gallagher

Internal and external parts don't need to be the same — they can work **together**, doing different things.
- Related to: **Material Engagement Theory**, **Distributed Cognition**

### 🌊 Third Wave: Beyond Complementarity – Ecological-Enactive and MCP View
Based on: Parisi & Prezioso (2025), Malafouris, Rietveld, Kiverstein

The environment doesn't just support thinking — it helps **make the mind**.

| Feature | First Wave | Second Wave | Third Wave |
|---------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Core Principle | Parity (same function) | Complementarity (teamwork) | Constitution (mind is made through things) |
| Example | Otto's notebook | Brain + tools = system | Media shape memory and self (MCP) |
| Media Role | Passive aid | Active helper | Constitutive + historical |
| Time Focus | Synchronic (now) | Some diachronic | Fully diachronic (history, culture matter) |

---

## Topic 9: Technical Images and False Memory

📘 Based on: Prezioso & Parisi (2025), Flusser (2000), Wade et al. (2002)

### What Are Technical Images?

**Technical Images** are photos, videos, or digital media automatically created by machines.

### The Hot Air Balloon Experiment (Wade et al., 2002)

- Participants were shown fake childhood photos of themselves in a hot air balloon
- Later, many of them **"remembered"** being there — even though it never happened

**Conclusion**: Seeing technical images can **create false memories**.

### Media and Memory: Two Views

| Traditional View | New View (Radical Mediation & MCP) |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Memory is inside the brain | Memory is shaped by media and environments |
| Images trigger recall | Images **constitute** memory |
| False memories are errors | False memories are part of how memory works |

## Topic 10: Material Engagement Theory (MET)

📘 Based on: Lambros Malafouris

**Material Engagement Theory** says that we don't just use objects — we **think through them**.

> "We don't just think about things — we think with and through things."

### Key Terms

- **Material Engagement**: The dynamic interaction between body, mind, and material objects
- **Thing-ing (vs Thinking)**: Thinking emerges during the physical interaction with materials
- **Enactive Signification**: Meaning is created in the process of engaging with things

---

## Topic 11: Ecological-Enactive Cognition

📘 Based on: Gallagher (2023), Prezioso & Parisi (2025), Rietveld & Kiverstein

**Ecological-Enactive Cognition** combines:
1. **Ecological Psychology** (Gibson): We perceive the world in terms of affordances
2. **Enactivism** (Varela, Thompson, Rosch): Cognition arises through action and interaction

### Key Concepts

- **Skilled Agency**: Cognition is based on practice, habit, and skill
- **Situatedness**: The mind is always in a place, in a body, doing something
- **Non-representational**: Meaning is made in the moment, through activity
- **Field of Affordances**: The world offers multiple possible actions at any moment

---

## Topic 12: Ecomedia & Media Ecology

📘 Based on: Prezioso & Parisi (2025), Durham Peters (2015)

### What Is Media Ecology?

**Media Ecology** is the study of media as **environments** that shape how we think, feel, act, and exist.

> Media are not just things we use — they are like the **air we breathe**. We live *inside* them.

Proposed by thinkers like **Marshall McLuhan** and **Neil Postman**.

### Key Ideas

- **Media are elemental**: Like air, water, fire, and earth, media shape how we exist
- **Blurred boundaries**: The line between tool and environment disappears
- **Media shape affordances**: What we can do depends on the media environment

---

## Topic 13: Critique of Anthropocentrism in Cognitive Science

### What is Anthropocentrism?

**Anthropocentrism** means putting humans at the center of everything — assuming that only human minds, bodies, and experiences really matter.

### Why Is This a Problem?

Modern theories argue that this view:
- **Limits understanding** of cognition
- **Ignores** how tools, media, and environments think **with** us
- **Overlooks non-human actors** (machines, animals, systems)
- **Forgets history, culture, and ecology**

### Key Critiques

| Critique | Related Theory |
|----------|---------------|
| Mind ≠ just brain | Extended Mind, Enactivism |
| Tools think with us | Material Engagement Theory (MET) |
| Media co-create identity | MCP, Radical Mediation |
| Systems think together | Distributed Cognition, Ecomedia |
| Mind is not only human | Postphenomenology, 4E Cognition |

---

## Summary: How All Theories Connect

| Theory | Core Idea |
|--------|-----------|
| Enactivism | Cognition comes from interaction |
| Ecological Psychology | We perceive the world through affordances |
| Radical Mediation | Media shape thought and identity |
| Material Engagement Theory | We think with and through materials |
| MCP (Mediational–Constitutional Principle) | Tools and media don't just help — they **make** the mind |

**Ecological-Enactive Cognition ties all of them together** — it's the base of the third wave of extended mind theory.
